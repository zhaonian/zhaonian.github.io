  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="muted">Effective date: 11 Aug 2025</div>

  <p>
    AiyaDrop is designed for private, local file transfer between your devices. The app creates a local hotspot and a
    local-only web page to send and receive files without using the public internet or any external server.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No account, no cloud, no analytics, no ads.</li>
    <li>No data leaves your devices; transfers occur over your local hotspot/LAN only.</li>
    <li>The app does not collect, store, or share personal data with the developer or third parties.</li>
    <li>Files you select are processed locally and stored only on your devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect any personal information, usage analytics, device identifiers, or location history. We do not run
    any remote servers that receive your content.
  </p>

  <h2>Information You Choose to Share Locally</h2>
  <p>
    When you use AiyaDrop you can select photos, videos, or files to send to another device on your local network. Those
    files are transmitted directly between your devices over the local hotspot or LAN. The content is not uploaded to
    any external service. Copies of received files are saved locally on the receiving device (e.g., app cache or a
    user-visible folder if configured).
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions and Purpose</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Internet / Network</strong>: Required to run the embedded local web server and WebSocket on your device.
      Traffic remains local to your hotspot/LAN.</li>
    <li><strong>Wi‑Fi state / change Wi‑Fi state / Nearby Wi‑Fi devices</strong>: Used to create and manage a
      device-hosted hotspot so peers can connect locally.</li>
    <li><strong>Location (legacy Android versions)</strong>: On older Android versions, Wi‑Fi APIs require location
      permission to manage local hotspots. AiyaDrop does not access or store your location.</li>
    <li><strong>Photos/Media/Files (when saving to user storage)</strong>: Only to read files you choose and to save
      files you receive onto your device. The app does not access anything you did not explicitly select.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not share your data with anyone. There are no third‑party SDKs for analytics or advertising.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention and Control</h2>
  <p>
    Files received during a session are stored locally on the device (for example, in the app’s cache directory or a
    user‑visible folder). You can delete them at any time in your file manager or by clearing the app’s data/cache.
    The app keeps no other records.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    AiyaDrop is not directed to children and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements. When we do, we will update the effective
    date above. Your continued use of the app after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
  </p>
